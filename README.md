# Portfolio

This is a repo for a portfolio page 
It will be posted at [https://lukenprogramming.github.io/newFolio/homepage.htm](https://lukenprogramming.github.io/newFolio/homepage.htm) 
and NOT [https://lukenprogramming.github.io/](https://lukenprogramming.github.io/) (which if you go to will simply lead to a site showing this MD file)

# Website Info As of 31/5/24

The site is best view on a desktop/tablet as I've not finished a part of the homepage.htm to be mobile suitable (although viewing on mobile should be fine and has (mostly) been adapted for mobile use).

Be sure to hover your mouse on the word 'responsive' in the header paragraph for some cool effects

The Contact page isn't yet functional, will find a way to make it work soon
